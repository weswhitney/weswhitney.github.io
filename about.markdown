I'm a full stack software engineer. I have 5+ years of experience as a full stack developer and another 4+ years of experience in the tech industry as an SDET (Software Developer in Test) and as an Operations Support Engineer. I've worked at Galvanize, Sovrn, Campspot, and Charter Communications. Outside of work I enjoy snowboarding, biking, hanging out with my family and friends, and birding.
